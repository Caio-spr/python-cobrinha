# snake game in python

I was bored so I decided to challenge myself by coding a game in python, a language I had never used

i'll do first just a simple canvas that will run the game, the player is represented by a series of black squares in a mesh of squares
the food will be triangles

secondly i will make a menu screen that opens once the game is executed, it will allow the player to change the size of the map,
the colors of the player and background and the speed of the game

after that i'll add in the top of the screen both a "score" and a "high score" section, the score being determined by the size of the player

then i'll add to the game special types of food that will change some of the rules of the game

the i'll add dificulties to the game "easy" "medium" "hard"

then a system to grind for skins
